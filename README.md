# budgie-pi-audio-switcher

Adds an applet for Ubuntu Budgie to allow easy switching from HDMI audio output to 3.5mm jack audio output.

This applet will only have the correct effect on a Raspberry Pi.

To install:

   chmod +x install.sh

   ./install.sh
   
   
This copies the files to /usr/lib/budgie-desktop/plugins/budgie-pi-audio-switcher/

To use, simply click the icon to switch modes.
The plugin can be configured to start up in HDMI mode, 3.5mm jack mode, or the last mode used.
